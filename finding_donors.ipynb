    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "** Please note ** that the the purpose of generating a naive predictor is simply to show what a base model without any intelligence would look like. In the real world, ideally your base model would be either the results of a previous model or could be based on a research paper upon which you are looking to improve. When there is no benchmark model set, getting a result better than random choice is a place you could start from.\n",

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "**Model 1: Support Vector Machines (SVM)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Real World Application: One of the real world application of SVM is in Bioinformatics. It is used in the classification of genes, patients on the basis of genes and other bilogical problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First advantage that comes to mind when I think about SVM is the regularization feature that is available. It definitely helps in preventing overfitting.\n",
    "- SVM provides different kernel functions and depending on the application, it can be used to solve complex problems. Kernel provides choosing a function which is not necessarily linear and can have different forms in terms of different data it operates on and thus is a non-parametric function.\n",
    "- Support Vector Machine classifier handles high dimensional data well.\n",
    "- SVM is defined by a convex optimisation problem (no local minima) for which there are efficient methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weakness:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Choosing a kernel function for particular application is difficult.\n",
    "- SVM does not perform very well when the data has more noise i.e., target classes are overlapping\n",
    "- It takes long training time if the dataset is large.\n",
    "- Since it just does classification by having larger boundary gap, there is no probabilstic explanation for the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Candidacy:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Since we need to avoid overfitting and SVM has regularization this makes a good choice.\n",
    "- Using SVM, boundary that the algorithm calculates doesn't have to be a straight line. The benefit is that we can capture much more complex relationships between our datapoints without having to perform difficult transformations.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Model 2: Ensemble Methods (AdaBoost)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Real World Application: Interesting application of AdaBoost is in customer relation sector for Customer Churn Prediction. Companies based on the predictions, can offer the right set of products or modify the sales strategy to prevent the loss of customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Versatile to use. Can be used with wide vareity of simple learners.\n",
    "- Faster algorithm.\n",
    "- Less prone to overfitting\n",
    "- Concentrates on misclassified data during training and thus improves overall performance of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weakness:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Noisy data and outliers affect the performance of the model. So preprocessing of the data is required.\n",
    "- Overfitting problem when the base classifier used is complex one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Candidacy:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Since our data is <100k and preprocessed (clean data), AdaBoost will perform well balancing the error and time to train.\n",

    "Real World Application: Text classification. Spam filters.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Requires small amount of data to estimate the data.\n",
    "- Easy to implement.\n",
    "- Faster training time compared to SVM.\n",
    "- Can be used for both binary and multi class classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weakness:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unrealistic nature of underlying assumption that features are independent. \n",
    "- Has zero frequency issue i.e. if the classifier comes across a unseen feature-label combination, it will estimate it to zero (0)\n",

    "The model I choose for performing the CharityML project would be AdaBoost. The reasoning behind this lies in the balance between the F-score and training time of the model when 100% data is used. Looking at the above graphs, we see that among the 3 models intially chosen to perform the training, GaussianNB trains the model the fastest. Slowest would be the SVC and AdaBoost being in between. When comparing the F1 score, AdaBoost performed significantly well while GaussianNB performed the least. And for this particular problem (suitability for the data), the data is **<100k** and is **clean (pre-processed)**. According to the cheat sheet (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/index.html), SVC classifier was checked. However it could not strike balance between computational performance and the F1 score. Adaboost perfromed well with the training subset both in computation performance aspect and F1 score. \n",

    "Decision Tree classifier:\n",
    "\n",
    "This model is essentially a decision making model where it is set up in such a way that it looks like a tree. There is a node where the question related to model is asked and the branches are the answers/outcomes. The leaf associated with the branch is the class label we are looking for. This is slightly better than guessing and thus they are called weak learners. \n",
    "\n",
    "Boosting:\n",
    "\n",
    "Boosting method can be referred as the process where the concentration is provided on the wrongly classified observations during training by the above decision tree classifier. For example, in a company there are different individuals with different expertise. No one is able to perform all the tasks with equal efficiency. Like a Hardware engineer cannot perform equally as the Software engineer doing a SW development. So integrating different individuals with different expertise to come together to develop a single HW-SW platform is way more efficient. This is called boosting (making use of individual specialities)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In AdaBoost method, model combines low accuracy (weak learners) to create a high accuracy (strong) models. Initially Adaboost selects random subset of data from the training set. It trains the model using the base classifier (Decision tree in this case) and based on the predictions assign higher weightage to wrongly classified data. So this algorithm is trained iteratively. This way in the next iteration, the algorithm focuses more on the wrongly classified observations and tries to classify them correctly. This process is repeated until there is no error or the user defined iterations. Also during this process, the classifier with higher prediction is also provided with weights. \n",

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
